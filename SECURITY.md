## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Sentinel, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. **DO** report via one of these secure channels:

- **Email**: [INSERT_SECURITY_EMAIL] (preferred)
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the Security tab
- **Private message**: Contact maintainers directly if you have access

### 3. **Include** the following information:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: OS, Node.js version, Sentinel version
- **Proof of concept**: If possible, include a safe PoC
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### 4. **Timeline**:

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix development**: Depends on complexity
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is available

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update your project dependencies
2. **Use latest versions**: Always use the latest stable version of Sentinel
3. **Review configurations**: Carefully review your `.sentinel.yml` configuration
4. **Monitor logs**: Watch for unusual activity in your GitHub Actions logs
5. **API key security**: Never commit API keys to your repository

### For Contributors

1. **Security review**: All code changes must pass security review
2. **Dependency scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies
3. **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
4. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. **Secrets management**: Never hardcode secrets or sensitive information

1. **Private reporting**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix development**: We develop and test fixes
4. **Release**: We release the fix in a new version
5. **Public disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix is available

### Public Disclosure Timeline
